# Fleet Command Center

**Conversational fleet management powered by Geotab + Google Maps + Gemini AI + Ace AI**

> Talk to your fleet. Ask questions in plain English, get real-time answers from your Geotab telematics data — with a live Google Maps dashboard, AI-powered analysis, animated trip replay, and one-click executive reports.

Built for the [Geotab Vibe Coding Competition 2026](https://luma.com/h6ldbaxp).

## The Problem

Fleet managers juggle multiple dashboards, reports, and interfaces to answer simple questions: *"Which truck has the worst fuel efficiency?"*, *"Are there any active fault codes?"*, *"How did our drivers score on safety this week?"*

Out of 776+ solutions in the Geotab Marketplace, **zero** offer a conversational AI interface. Fleet managers are stuck clicking through menus instead of just asking.

## The Solution

A full-stack fleet command center that combines:

- **20 MCP tools** for any AI assistant (Claude, GPT, etc.) to query fleet data
- **Live Google Maps dashboard** with real-time vehicle tracking
- **Gemini AI chat** with function calling (create zones, send messages, analyze data)
- **Geotab Ace AI integration** for fleet-native insights
- **Trip replay** with GPS breadcrumb animation and speed telemetry
- **Executive reports** generated by Gemini + Ace AI, exportable as HTML/PDF
- **Voice input** via Web Speech API
- **SQLite vehicle enrichment** for presentation-grade fleet data

```
You: "Show me all vehicles in my fleet"
AI:  Here are your 50 vehicles — 15 vans, 12 pickups, 8 sedans, 8 SUVs, 4 EVs, 3 heavy trucks...

You: "Which one has the worst fuel efficiency this month?"
AI:  Unit 48 — Hino 195 averaged 4.2 MPG, significantly below fleet average of 6.8 MPG.

You: "Create a geofence around 123 Main St, Toronto"
AI:  Geocoded → Created zone 'Main St Depot' with 500m radius. ✓

You: "Generate a fleet report"
AI:  [Opens executive report with Gemini analysis + Ace AI insights — Print/Save HTML/Save PDF]

## Features

### Dashboard UI
- **Real-time vehicle markers** on Google Maps with status colors (green=moving, grey=stopped, red=fault, dark=offline)
- **Auto-refresh** every 10 seconds
- **Vehicle detail panel** — click any marker for driver, department, make/model, VIN, odometer, engine hours, faults, trips
- **Vehicle search** — filter by name, driver, department, or make
- **Fleet KPI cards** — total distance, trips, idle %, driving hours, max speed, exceptions
- **Geofence overlays** on the map
- **Dark/light theme** with glass-morphism styling

### Map Controls
- **Heatmap** — activity density visualization across the fleet operating area (~1000 synthetic points from vehicle positions)
- **Lock View** — prevent auto-pan/zoom on data refresh so you can inspect a specific area
- **Solo Mode** — hide all markers except the selected vehicle for focused viewing
- **Fit All** — one-click zoom to show the entire fleet

### Trip Replay
- **GPS breadcrumb animation** with play/pause/speed controls
- **Speed-colored path** — green (slow), yellow (normal), red (fast), grey (stopped)
- **Live telemetry HUD** — speed, acceleration, distance, elapsed time, avg/max speed
- **Slider scrubbing** — jump to any point in the trip

### Fleet Reports
- **Executive report** generated by Gemini AI + Geotab Ace AI
- **Export**: Print, Save as HTML (standalone file with embedded styles), Save as PDF (via browser print)
- Sections: Executive Summary, Fleet Overview, Top Performers, Anomalies, Ace AI Insights, Recommendations

### AI Chat
- **Gemini AI** with function calling — natural language fleet queries
- **Action commands**: create geofences, send text messages to vehicles
- **Voice input** via Web Speech API with interim transcription
- **Text-to-speech** for short AI responses
- **Session history** with clear/reset

### Geotab Ace AI
- Direct natural language queries against the fleet dataset
- Integrated into executive reports for fleet-native insights
- Standalone `/api/ace` endpoint

### Vehicle Enrichment Layer
- **SQLite database** (`fleet_enrichment.db`) overlays realistic fleet data onto the demo dataset
- 50-vehicle Canadian mixed fleet: 15 vans, 12 pickups, 8 sedans, 8 SUVs, 4 EVs, 3 heavy trucks
- Driver names, departments (Delivery/Service/Sales/Executive/Field Ops), odometers, engine hours, VINs
- **Toggle on/off** via `/api/enrichment/toggle` — clean API-only fallback
- API real-time fields (GPS, speed, status) always take priority

### Caching
- **TTL-based in-memory cache** on all API routes (vehicles 60s, locations 30s, trips 5min, zones 5min, faults 2min)
- **Batch location fetching** — 1 API call for all vehicles instead of N+1
- **Cross-endpoint cache sharing** — `/api/status` reuses vehicle/location/fault caches
- **`?refresh=1`** query param to force-bypass any cache

### API Call Tracker
- **SQLite database** (`api_tracker.db`) logs every external API call (Geotab, Gemini, Ace)
- Tracks service, method, status, response time (ms), errors, and cache hits
- **`/api/tracker`** endpoint returns usage summary (grouped by service/status) + recent calls
- Supports `?hours=N` and `?limit=N` query params for filtering
- Essential for monitoring quota usage (e.g. Gemini free tier 20 req/day)
